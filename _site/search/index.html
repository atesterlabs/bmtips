We will login to an additional account rather than using an existing Gmail account for this example. Tap Another Google Account\n\n\n\nAfterwards, we enter the credentials for our new account including the username and password. Gmail uses OAuth to ensure your account is always secure. To learn more about OAuth, visit our tip\n\n\n\nLastly, we need to set up the name and description for our new account. The name is what recipients will see when you send an email whereas the account description is how you can identify your new account in BlueMail. Some users like to use colors to differentiate your accounts, and with BlueMail, you can change the color easily."

						"content": "How Can BlueMail Help Me Get Stuff Done?\n\nGetting Stuff Done is a method of organization that helps to make achieving tasks much more easy. Your inbox is organized by the time an email was received, and while this is important, does not necessarily indicate which emails require more urgency than others. With BlueMail’s Getting Stuff Done feature, this becomes much more simple with the addition of the Task List and Reminders.\n\nWhat is Snooze? How to Snooze+ an Email?\n\n\n\nSometimes you are in a context when handling the mail is not effective, possible or reasonable. You may need to wait to a certain time, be in a certain place, or have certain resources or pre-requisites. For those emails you can defer the handling. BlueMail has ready made time frames set for you: later today, end of day, next day / week/ month, or someday in the future. You can also pick a specific date/time, which is useful when you know exactly when would be the most suitable time to handle this mail.\n\nWhen you Snooze+ an email it will be added to Tasks\n\nYou can add an email to tasks / Snooze an email using these methods:\n\n\n  Using the Bottom Bar Actions in Mail View.\n  Using Swipe Options in List View\n\n\nNote: that if you use the Incoming Filter you won’t see emails marked as Snooze+.\n\nWhat are Tasks?\n\nTasks view shows all the Snoozed mails. This view allows you to distinguish all the emails you need to handle ordered from the most urgent ones. You can also see mails whose designated time has elapsed. This allows you to prioritize your time based on urgency as well as importance.\n\nWhen each such task reaches it’s designated time, you get a push notification, also called snooze, as a reminder.\n\nWhat are Snooze Notifications or Reminders?\n\nOnce you have snoozed some mails, they appear as tasks with due time, sorted by urgency. When each such “task” reaches it’s designated time, you get a push notifications, also called snooze, as a reminder, to let you know that this was the right time for you to handle this mail, and make sure you get what you need, in the time that you asked for it.\n\nWhat is Done? How to Mark an Email as Done?\n\n\n\nMark as Done moves the mail to the “Done” tab and marks it like that. It means there is nothing more to do with this mail, but it is still valuable for you to keep.\n\nUsing More… | Global Settings | Auto Mark as Done setting, you can cause replied messages to be automatically marked as Done. By default this setting is Off.\n\nYou can mark an email as Done with those methods:\n\n\n  Using the Bottom Bar Actions in Mail View\n  Using Swipe Options in List View\n\n\nNote: That if you use the Incoming Filter you won’t see emails marked as done.\n\nAn Email is Marked as Done by mistake. How can I Return it to my Inbox?\n\nWith BlueMail you can “reopen” mail marked Done, to be Undone and back into inbox. Simply tap on Inbox | choose Done filter | Swipe the email to the right | Undone and the email will move back to the inbox folder.\n\nWhat is the Default to Assign an Email for This Evening? Tomorrow Morning? Later Today?\n\n\n  Later Today is set to three hours ahead\n  This Evening is set to 07:00 PM of today\n  Tomorrow Morning is set to 09:00 AM the next day\n  Next Week is set to a week ahead\n  In a Month is set to a month ahead\n  Some Day adds the email to the task list without a certain due date\n  Pick Date allows you to choose the date and time\n\n\nNote: Before 09:00 AM the option for Tomorrow morning will be This Morning, meaning it will be set to 9:00 today.\n\nYou can change the default setting for Later Today using More… | Global Settings | Later Today Default.\n\nWhat are the Filters on the Top Bar Menu?\n\nFilters allow you to quickly find messages important to you from your contacts, services, and even messages that you haven’t read.\n\n\n  All – Displays all emails in the Inbox inc. Done, Snooze etc.\n  Unread – Displays unread emails, so you never miss out on any email sent.\n  Starred – Displays all your starred, flagged, important emails.\n  Incoming – Similar to the ‘All’ filter, without the Snoozed and Done emails, so they don’t get mixed in with the rest of your emails.\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to change the default filter.\n\nWhat is the Difference between Snooze+ Filter and Tasks View?\n\nSnooze filter and Tasks view shows all the Snoozed mails. While Snooze filter works like traditional filter on a mailbox, Tasks show a dedicated urgency view, with the most pressing emails on top, to let you focus on what matters.\n\nWhere will Snoozed/Done Emails be in Other Mail Clients/Web/PC?\n\nSnooze+ and Done are internal features of BlueMail. We are not moving those emails elsewhere in your folders.\n\nSounds Great! How can you Help me Reach a Zero Inbox?\n\nWith Getting Stuff Done, achieving a Zero Inbox is easy. It starts when you receive an email. You can either delete it, forward it to someone, or take action. If you are unable to act on the email quickly, simply schedule it for later. BlueMail will send you a notification when it is time to take care of the task. Have a little extra time and want to take care of the email earlier? Visit your Task List and cross it off. In no time, you will have a Zero Inbox!"

However, some emails may still get through to your inbox.\n\nDoes BlueMail Support Spam Management?\n\nBlueMail offers a Spam Management tool to supplement your provider’s existing spam filter by providing an option to Block emails that your provider’s “spam filter” did not catch. These Blocked emails will be added to your Block List (spam list) and future emails from this Sender, Domain, or Suffix (as per your choice) will go directly to the Spam folder bypassing your inbox.\nNote: The Block List for BlueMail is personal and local only for you while using BlueMail\n\nHow to Block a Sender?\n\nThere are two ways to Block a Sender:\n\n\n  You can open the email and tap the 3-dot menu | Block Sender:\n  You can use BlueMail’s Swipe Menu which can be easily configured with a shortcut to “Block Sender”.\n\n\nAfter you’ve selected Block Sender, you can choose one of the following:\n\n\n  Block Sender – Any mail that was received from this specific email address will automatically move to the Spam folder.\n  Block whole domain – Any mail that was received from this domain will automatically be moved to the Spam folder.\n  Block Entire Suffix – Any mail that was received from this Suffix will automatically be moved to the Spam folder.\n\n\nFor example, with the address: “Spammer@spammer.spam.com”\n\n\n  The Sender is ”Spammer@spammer.spam.com”\n  The Domain is “@spammer.spam.com”\n  The Suffix is “.spam.com”\n\n\nWhen Blocking using one of the above criteria, only the specific email you Block will be currently moved to Spam. From now on, all future emails from that sender’s address or domain will now arrive in your Spam folder.\n\nPlease note: Other emails currently in the Inbox with this address, domain, or suffix will now display a Red Spam Indicator on the avatar.\n\n\n\nHow to Unblock a Sender?\n\nTo Unblock a sender, go to the Spam | Open the email | Tap the 3-dot-menu | Unblock Sender | confirm with OK.\n\nIf your provider identified the email as spam, it will not have a Red Spam Indicator on it and will move the email to the Spam folder automatically. BlueMail will not be able to change this.\n\nThe Red Spam Indicator appears for emails Blocked using BlueMail’s Spam Manager. The Red Spam Indicator will not appear on Emails that your provider has filtered as spam.\n\n\n\nHow do I Remove a Sender, Domain, or Suffix from The Block List?\n\nEmail Addresses, Domains, and Suffixes that were previously Blocked on BlueMail are displayed in the Block List.\n\nTo edit the Block List in BlueMail, please tap More… | Various Account Settings | select the account | Block List | select either Address, Domain, or Suffix | tap the red X\n\n\n\nBy tapping the red (X), you remove that Address, Domain, or Suffix and continue to receive emails from those addresses."
