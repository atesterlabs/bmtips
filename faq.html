  - question: How to Delete from the Client and not from the Server in IMAP?
    answer: POP3 users are used to a client setting, that allows emails deleted from the client to be kept on the server. Modern IMAP servers support multiple clients efficiently and delete from the server as soon as you delete from the client (to make sure all other clients are in sync).
  - question: How to Move Emails to a Specific Folder?
    answer: Go to Accounts \| Tap your Account \| Folder Mapping \| Archive folder and match it to the folder you like for that account. You will be able to use the Archive action and directly move mails to that folder in one click!
  - question: Resizing the Scrollable Widget
    answer: When you initially add a scrollable widget, it takes 3×3 box as default on your home screen. You can resize it to any dimension up to stretching it to the full size of your home screen, by dragging the resize handles, as long as it has space free of other widgets on that home screen page. Below is a fully stretched widget.
  - question: How to Mark an email as Done? How to keep emails on the Server?
    answer:While using an IMAP account, BlueMail keeps your emails on your provider’s server by default so you can retrieve them from multiple devices. Only when you delete an email, will it be deleted from the server and that action will be synced to your other clients and devices.
  - question: Is BlueMail Coming to Windows?
    answer: Certainly! BlueMail for Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10 is almost ready and will be ready for release soon. You can sign up to try the beta, and when it is ready, we will reach out to you.
