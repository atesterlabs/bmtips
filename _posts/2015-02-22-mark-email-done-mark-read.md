We have a set of [Filters](/top-bar-left-triangle-menu/) on the top picker where *All = Incoming + Snoozed + Done*.
[Marking as](/mark-an-email-as-done/) [done](/mark-an-email-as-done/) allows you not to see that mail (it still exists) when using *Incoming*Â filter.

Read / Unread is involuntary and provides the state of the mail.

Note: You will see both Read and Unread using *Incoming*. You have *Unread* filter and you can use it to see only Unread mail.
