<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="color: #000000;">BlueMail</span>Â itself does not have a size limit on your attachments. However, most email providers have some limit on the overall size of a single mail they allow to send to their servers. It is typically in the 10-25MB range, please consult your provider for more details.</span></p>
