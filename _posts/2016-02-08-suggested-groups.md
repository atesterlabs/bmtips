<p>Suggested Groups are Groups that are not fully defined yet e.g. Without a name or avatar. They are displayed under the Suggested Group tab.</p>
<p>Tap More (o o o) | <em>Edit Profile, Groups &amp; Contacts | Groups tab | </em><em>Suggested Groups</em> | Scroll through the list of &lt;Suggest a name&gt; until you see a group you wish to create.</p>
<p>Tap on them to edit and define them. To learn more about Groups, click <a href="/naming-a-group-and-setting-a-photo/">here</a>.</p>
