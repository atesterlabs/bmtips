Suggested Groups are Groups that are not fully defined yet e.g. Without a name or avatar. They are displayed under the Suggested Group tab.

Tap *More...* \| *Edit Profile, Groups &amp; Contacts* \| *Groups tab* \| *Suggested Groups* \| *Scroll through the list of &lt;Suggest a name&gt; until you see a group you wish to create*.

Tap on them to edit and define them. To learn more about Groups, click [here](/naming-a-group-and-setting-a-photo/).
