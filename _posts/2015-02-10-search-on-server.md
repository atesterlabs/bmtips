<p>With <span style="color: #000000;">BlueMail</span> you can easily search by tapping the Magnifying Glass icon in the top bar icon, to locate specific emails using keywords.</p>
<p>Our search looks for your query string in a given folder you are currently viewing, and looks for both client downloaded and server emails ("old" emails in that folder).</p>
<p>To find emails on server, go to the <em>Unified</em> account | type your keyword in the search | when prompted with results choose the account on which you wish to further search on server from the bottom.</p>
<p>We search your subject, body, and recipients so you can use words from any of those fields to find your emails.</p>
<p>Once you get search results you can tap to see a specific mail, or long tap to multi edit and perform actions on some or all of the results. See more in <a title="How to get to multi-edit for search results?" href="/faq/how-to-get-to-multi-edit-for-search-results">Multi-Edit</a>.</p>
