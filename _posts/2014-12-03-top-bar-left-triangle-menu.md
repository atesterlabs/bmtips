*Filters* allow you to quickly find messages important to you from your contacts, services, and even messages that you haven’t read.

* **All** – Displays all emails in the Inbox inc. Done, Snooze etc.
* **Unread** – Displays unread emails, so you never miss out on any email sent.
* **Starred** – Displays all your starred, flagged, important emails.
* **Incoming** – Similar to the ‘All’ filter, without the Snoozed and Done emails, so they don’t get mixed in with the rest of your emails.
