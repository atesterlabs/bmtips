Using [Snooze+](/mark-as-later/) you can postpone handling emails for a later time, these are the default times for each option:

* Later Today is set to three hours ahead
* This Evening is set to 07:00 PM of today
* Tomorrow Morning is set to 09:00 AM the next day
* Next Week is set to a week ahead
* In a Month is set to a month ahead
* Some Day adds the email to the task list without a certain due date
* Pick Date allows you to choose the date and time

Note: Before 09:00 AM the option for *Tomorrow morning* will be *This Morning*, meaning it will be set to 9:00 today.

You can change the default setting for *Later Today* using *More...* \| *Global Settings* \| *Later Today Default*.
