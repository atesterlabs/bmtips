If a picture is worth 1,000 words, a video is priceless. Whether you want to show your friends a cool new BlueMail feature, or show our support team an interesting issue, using a screen recording is one of the most effective tools to do so.

In order to take a video using your device, we recommend installing a screen recording application. We have found that many of our users enjoy using [Lollipop Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rivulus.screenrecording) and [AZ Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free).

If you would like to share the video with our support team, simply upload it to your favorite site/cloud storage service and send the link to our [support team](mailto:support@bluemail.me).
