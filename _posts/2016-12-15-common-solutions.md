## First Things First

Did you know that most difficulties with an application can be solved in a few quick steps? We have some simple and easy procedures that can quickly get you back to emailing in no time.

## Network

If your device is experiencing connectivity issues, you may need to change the network your device is connected to. In many cases, this is done by simply switching your network between WiFi and cellular data or restarting your device.

For devices that do not have a connection to a mobile cellular network, switching between WiFi networks should also help.

## Restart

Most mobile electronics need to be turned off and back on from time to time to ensure they are functioning optimally. While each device is different, generally restarting your device is done by pressing and holding the power button until the shutdown menu displays.
