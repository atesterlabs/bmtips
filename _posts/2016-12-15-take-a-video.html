<p>If a picture is worth 1,000 words, a video is priceless. Whether you want to show your friends a cool new BlueMail feature, or show our support team an interesting issue, using a screen recording is one of the most effective tools to do so.</p>
<p>In order to take a video using your device, we recommend installing a screen recording application. We have found that many of our users enjoy using <a href="//play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rivulus.screenrecording">Lollipop Screen Recorder</a> and <a href="//play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free">AZ Screen Recorder</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to share the video with our support team, simply upload it to your favorite site/cloud storage service and send the link to our <a href="mailto:support@bluemail.me">support team</a>.</p>
