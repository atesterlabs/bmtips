<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cluster mode is an exciting feature that revolutionizes how you see your email. By organizing your inbox by sender, keeping on top of your email has never been easier.</span></p>
<p>You can disable Clusters by simply tapping the top action bar in the middle (on the triangle), where you can change accounts and filters and choose from the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clusters On – Enables Clusters for all emails including all people, groups and services</li>
<li>Clusters Only Services – Clusters emails from services, while disabling clusters for people and groups</li>
<li>Clusters Off – Disables Clusters for all type of emails</li>
</ul>

<p>You can re-enable Clusters at any time from the same menu.</p>
