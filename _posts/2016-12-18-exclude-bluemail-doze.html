<p>Android 6 and 7 has some new features built into the OS which might affect performance some applications such as BlueMail.</p>
<p>One of them is the "Doze" feature that turns off the Network connection if the device hasn't been touched or moved for a while.</p>
<p>Open the Settings menu on your device and tap <em>Battery</em>. Next, tap the more button on the action bar at the top right, and select <em>Battery optimization</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5160" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/BlueMail-Doze.png" alt="bluemail-doze" width="320" height="569" /></p>
<p>On the Battery optimization screen, switch to the All apps list from the drop-down to view all of the apps on your device. Tap BlueMail from the menu and select <em>Don’t optimize</em> to exclude BlueMail from the Doze feature.</p>
