### What are Aliases?

An **Alias** is an alternate email address that points to your existing email account. This means that an email sent *to* your alias would appear in the same email inbox as your main email address. You can also send an email *from* your alternate email address without switching accounts.

From talking to home buyers, selling your car, or looking for a job, aliases are a perfect solution for when you may want to use a temporary email address.

Sending an email using an Alias is done by simply selecting the *From* address within the compose email view.
