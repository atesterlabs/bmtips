<p>To manage your folders tap More (o o o)<em> | Various Account Settings | Tap your Account | Folder Management | Folder Mapping</em>.</p>
<p>To change the folder mapping, simply tap the folder you wish to map from, and select the folder you wish to map to.</p>
<p>In general, your mapping should match the folders your provider’s web client is using.<br />
This will help ensure that your sync is performed correctly.</p>
<p>Emails that you archive/delete/send in <span style="color: #000000;">BlueMail</span> will be placed in the parallel named folder for later access on your Web Client and vice versa.</p>
<p>Note: Folder mapping is applied only to IMAP and Exchange and not for POP3.</p>
