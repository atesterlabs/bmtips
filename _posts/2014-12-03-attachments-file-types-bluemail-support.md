BlueMail supports adding an attachment from your photos or videos libraries, documents, PDFs and other kinds of attachments. BlueMail uses native applications to open a viewer that is suitable for the attachment on the receiving end point, based on the receiver preferences.

To add an attachment to your email - get into email compose mode by tapping on the Compose icon (or *Reply*, *Reply all*, *Forward and similar actions*) \| tap the [3-dot Menu in the top bar](/3-dot-menu-compose) \| _**Attach a File**_.
