<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once you have snoozed some emails, they appear as tasks with due time, sorted by urgency. When each such "task" reaches it's designated time, you get a push notifications, also called snooze, as a reminder, to let you know that this was the right time for you to handle this mail, and make sure you get what you need, in the time that you asked for it. This is how you can really Get Things Done!</span></p>
