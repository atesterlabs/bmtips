The different symbols represent certain states of an email; you can see those symbols on the images/avatars of the sender:

* [High Priority Email](/send-email-with-high-priority/) -  Blue circle and an arrow up within.
* [Replied Email](/how-can-i-differentiate-a-forwarded-from-a-replied-email/) - Arrow to the left.
* [Forwarded Email](/how-can-i-differentiate-a-forwarded-from-a-replied-email/) - Arrow to the right.
