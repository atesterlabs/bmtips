<p>We have a set of <a title="What are the filters on the Top Bar Menu: All, Unread, Starred, Incoming, Later, Done?" href="/top-bar-left-triangle-menu/">Filters</a> on the top picker where <em>All = Incoming + Snoozed + Done</em>.</p>
<p><a title="How to Mark an Email as Done?" href="/mark-an-email-as-done/">Marking as</a><a title="How to Mark an Email as Done?" href="/mark-an-email-as-done/"> Done</a> allows you not to see that mail (it still exists) when using <em>Incoming</em> filter.</p>
<p>Read / Unread is involuntary and provides the state of the mail.</p>
<p>Note: You will see both Read and Unread using <em>Incoming</em>. You have <em>Unread</em> filter and you can use it to see only Unread mail.</p>
