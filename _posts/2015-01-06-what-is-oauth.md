<p><span style="color: #000000;">BlueMail</span> uses the highest privacy &amp; security authentication available for your provider.</p>
<p>Some providers such as Gmail and Outlook, support <a title="What is OAuth?" href="/what-is-oauth/">OAuth</a>, which means that <span style="color: #000000;">BlueMail</span> does not handle your login credentials at all. Instead, OAuth works by approving <span style="color: #000000;">BlueMail</span> as an application, and letting it access your mail, for as long as you would like.</p>
<p>This process involves authorization directly with your provider (who already knows your credentials: username and password) afterwards, BlueMail is given a token that you can control and revoke at any given time.</p>
<p>Sometimes when your provider has made a change to their security policy, they may ask you to reauthorize your account to refresh your OAuth token. BlueMail will prompt you to reauthorize your account when there has been a change to the token by your provider.</p>
<p>For Outlook follow <a href="/oauth-outlook/">these steps</a>.</p>
<p>For Yahoo follow <a href="/oauth-yahoo/">these steps</a>.</p>
<p>For Gmail, follow <a href="/oauth-gmail/">these steps</a>.</p>
<p>You can read about OAuth here: <a title="Google OAuth" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/google-oauth-2-0-for-gmail-and-talk/">http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/google-oauth-2-0-for-gmail-and-talk/</a>.</p>
