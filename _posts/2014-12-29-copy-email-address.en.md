BlueMail offers a few ways to achieve this:

* You can quick tap on the avatar / image of a sender from the mail list, and you will see the option to *Copy* this contact.
* You can do the same from the mail view itself.
* You can long tap the sender (bold text) from the mail view and then <em>Copy Email Address </em>option.</li>
* Lastly, and again from mail view, you can tap <em>More Details</em>, long tap any contact and then the <em>Copy Email Address </em>option.</li>
