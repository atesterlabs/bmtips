<p>During 2016 Yahoo rolled out OAuth 2.0 - a new superior way to authenticate and we are happy they joined Gmail &amp; Outlook to support this secure authentication standard.</p>
<p><strong>BlueMail</strong> is fully compliant with this standard, so if you have received an email from Yahoo regarding this, or have received a notification within <strong>BlueMail</strong>, we suggest you <a href="/remove-add-account/">remove and re-add</a> your account to automatically benefit from this more secure protocol.</p>
<p>You can read more about Yahoo's new App Access and Security <a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN27791.html">here</a>.</p>
