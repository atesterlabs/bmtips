BlueMail fully supports Conversations and smartly aggregates all of your emails that are Sent and Received in the same conversation, and threads them into one conversation for your convenience. You can perform bulk operations on the entire conversation as well.

In the mail list view, a conversation is indicated by the last incoming sender's details and time, as well as the count of exchanged emails in that conversation. Tapping on the avatar will show all the emails in that conversation. Please note that *Done* / *Snooze* operations are disabled in a conversation.

To Enable / Disable "Conversations" please tap *More* (o o o) \| *Global Settings* \| *Conversations/Clusters* \| **Enable Conversations**
While viewing the conversation, you can sort the order of the conversation items by selecting the 3 dot menu and then pressing "*Change Conversation Sort*.
