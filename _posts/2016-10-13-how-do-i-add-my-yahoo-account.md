During 2016 Yahoo rolled out OAuth 2.0 - a new superior way to authenticate and we are happy they joined Gmail & Outlook to support this secure authentication standard.

**BlueMail** is fully compliant with this standard, so if you have received an email from Yahoo regarding this, or have received a notification within **BlueMail**, we suggest you [remove and re-add](/remove-add-account/) your account to automatically benefit from this more secure protocol.
