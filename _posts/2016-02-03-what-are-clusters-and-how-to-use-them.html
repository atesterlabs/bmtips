<p><span style="color: #000000">BlueMail</span> organizes similar emails together to remove a lot of clutter from your inbox, without hiding any emails. It categorizes emails from known services into smart clusters, and organizes your emails into a sub-folder structure automatically, without the hassle to manage it manually.</p>
<p>Any email that comes into a service cluster acts as a reminder for the previous emails you might have missed, so as soon as a new email is received from that service, the service cluster pops up to the top of your inbox.</p>
<p>Tapping a service cluster will open service view, and you will see all messages received from that service.</p>
<p>To open the newest email in a service cluster, tap on '»'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can customize your notification settings per service cluster by going to More (o o o) | Notifications | Cluster Notifications | Tap on a cluster.</p>
<p>There are multiple actions to use on service clusters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mute Notifications</li>
<li>Mark all as read</li>
<li>Delete All</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can disable service clusters by going to More (o o o) | Global Settings | Conversations/Clusters | disable Enable Clusters.</p>
