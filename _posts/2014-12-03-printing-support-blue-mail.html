<h2>Configuring Your Device to Print</h2>
<p>Printing an email in BlueMail is supported by using Google Cloud Print.</p>
<p>To enable this, you need to install <a href="//play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.cloudprint">Google Cloud Print</a> from the Play Store</p>
<p>You may also need to go to your phone settings and enable printing. Generally on many devices the path is <em>Settings | Connections | Networks | Printing and turn on Google Cloud Print</em>, however this can vary from device to device.</p>
<h2>Printing an Email</h2>
<p>To print an email, simply tap the vertical 3-dot menu located on the bottom bar and then tap <em>More Options | Print</em>.</p>
<p>From here, we can select which printer to use and configure the details of the print job.</p>
