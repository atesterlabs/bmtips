To enable unread count badge for devices whose native manufacturer launcher are not yet supported by BlueMail, you may:

* Install a launcher that supports an unread count, such as the most common ones.
* If you have multiple launchers installed, please switch to the native one provided with your phone.
* BlueMail allows you to see the number of unread emails you have through the 1×1 widget, and also allows you to configure which email account you want to look at (you can configure multiple 1×1 widgets). Pressing the widget on your homescreen will get you directly to the inbox of that account (or unified inbox). You can also add a scrollable widget which has an unread badge at the top line.
