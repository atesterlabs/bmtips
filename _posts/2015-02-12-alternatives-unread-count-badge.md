<p>To enable unread count badge for devices whose native manufacturer launcher are not yet supported by <span style="color: #000000;">BlueMail</span>, you may:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install a launcher that supports an unread count, such as the most common ones.</li>
<li>If you have multiple launchers installed, please switch to the native one provided with your phone.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">BlueMail</span> allows you to see the number of unread emails you have through the 1×1 widget, and also allows you to configure which email account you want to look at (you can configure multiple 1×1 widgets). Pressing the widget on your homescreen will get you directly to the inbox of that account (or unified inbox). You can also add a scrollable widget which has an unread badge at the top line.</li>
</ol>
