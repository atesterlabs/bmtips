BlueMail's stunning Dark Theme is easy on the eyes for night time, and can switch automatically to light mode based on your time preference.
There are two ways to enable Dark Theme:

* From the pull-down picker, tap Dark Mode On

By default dark mode will apply to your mail view, however, if you wish to keep mail view in light mode, simply tap *Mail View Theme* and select *Light*.

To Enable dark mode for only certain hours of the day, Tap *Automatically enable dark theme during specific hours*. Dark mode will be enabled *from* the time you select, and will remain on until (*to*) the time you prefer.

While Dark mode is enabled, you can also invert the avatar colors and change the icons to orange to make them stand out.
