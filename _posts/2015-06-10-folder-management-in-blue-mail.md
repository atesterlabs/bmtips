To Create, Rename or Delete a Folder, tap *More...* \| *Accounts* \| *Choose Account* \| *Folder Management* and choose:

* Create Folder - Enter a folder name and tap **OK**
* Rename Folder - Choose folder to rename, enter a new name and tap **OK**
* Delete Folder - Choose the folder to delete and confirm by tapping **YES** (or cancel the operation by tapping **NO**)

### Notes:

IMAP and Exchange Accounts - Folder Operations will be synced to your Mail Server, hence if you Create, Rename or Delete a Folder,  BlueMail  will perform the same operation on the server.

POP3 Accounts - Folders are local and exist only on your device. If you Create, Rename or Delete a Folder, it will only exist in BlueMail on that device.
