To customize the sound notifications, please follow these steps:

*More...* \| *Notifications* \| *Scroll to the desired account* \| *Sound\|Vibrate\|LED* \| **Custom Incoming Sounds** and choose the new incoming email sound.

### Notes

* Check you are not in silent mode when checking sound notifications.
* Android can play only one sound at a time, so if you receive notifications on your emails from more than one app - only one sound will be played.
