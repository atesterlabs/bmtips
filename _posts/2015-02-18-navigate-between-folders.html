<p>To view the folders for your current account, please tap the top-left corner and a panel with the folders list will be shown underneath the account's name. You can also see the panel by swiping from the middle left edge of the screen.</p>
<p>We show folders created by your email provider first, followed by your custom folders. Simply swipe down to reveal the remainder of your folder list.</p>
<p>Folders created by your mail provider are called system folders. When using an IMAP account, these cannot be changed or deleted unless you do so with your provider. Here are some examples of system folders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inbox</li>
<li>Drafts</li>
<li>Sent</li>
<li>Trash</li>
<li>Spam</li>
<li>Outbox</li>
<li>Archive/All</li>
</ul>
<p>All other folders are user created and can be renamed, deleted, copied, moved, or created.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em>Â The <em>Inbox</em> folder is the only one that syncs regularly, the other folders sync the instant you open them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
