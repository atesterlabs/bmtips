## Configuring Your Device to Print

Printing an email in BlueMail is supported by using Google Cloud Print.

To enable this, you need to install [Google Cloud Print](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.cloudprint) from the Play Store

You may also need to go to your phone settings and enable printing. Generally on many devices the path is *Settings* \| *Connections* \| *Networks* \| *Printing* and turn **on** Google Cloud Print, however this can vary from device to device.

## Printing an Email

To print an email, simply tap the vertical 3-dot menu located on the bottom bar and then tap *More Options* \| **Print**.

From here, we can select which printer to use and configure the details of the print job.
