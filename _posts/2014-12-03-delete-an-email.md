You can Delete an email with these methods:

* Using the [Bottom Bar Actions in Mail View](/bottom-bar-options-type-mail/)
* Using [Swipe Options in List View](/swipe-menu-options-type-mail/)

You can set to confirm before deleting, using *More* \| *Global Settings* \| *Advanced Features* \| **Confirm Before Deleting**

Note: For Gmail accounts you can configure the delete action to be [Archive instead of Delete](/gmails-all-mail-folder-typemail/) using settings.
