There are three ways to create a new Group:

* If you've sent or received an email with more than one recipient, tap the group avatar (icon) and you'll get a screen where you can edit the group info.
* Another way is to save a [suggested group](/suggested-groups/), tap *More...* \| *Edit Profile, Groups &amp; Contacts* \| *Select Groups tab* \| *Select &lt;Suggested Groups&gt; tab* \| *Tap on a Group*.
* To create a group from scratch, tap *More...* \| *Edit Profile, Groups &amp; Contacts* \| *Select Groups tab* \| *CREATE* \| *Add contacts* \| *Add Image and Name*.

To delete a group, simply remove the group name and photo using the group edit menu.
