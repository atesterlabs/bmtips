If the "All Mail" folder isn't displayed in BlueMail, follow these steps to resolve it:

1. Login to Gmail from your desktop / web browser.
2. Click on *Options* \| *Settings* \| *IMAP* - and enable IMAP.
3. Go to *Labels* - look for "All Mail" and select *Show in IMAP*.

Then you should see your Gmail's "All Mail" folder in BlueMail.
