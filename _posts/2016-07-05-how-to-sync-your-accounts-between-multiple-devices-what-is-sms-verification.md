<p>BlueMail allows you to safely sync all your accounts to your other or new devices! To do it both easily and safely please follow the following steps:</p>
<p>On your other/new device, add an account you already had on your old device.</p>
<p>You will get a system message that allows you to sync your accounts by tapping <em>Verify Number</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4211" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1_thumb-1.png" alt="1_thumb" width="240" height="303" />If you choose <em>Later</em> you can always get back to the sync process by tapping More (o o o) <em>| Global Settings | Advanced Features | Backup Accounts</em></p>
<p>You will need to enter your mobile phone number.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4214 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2_thumb.png" alt="2_thumb" width="242" height="169" /></p>
<p>Press <em>Send</em> and after a short while you will get an SMS with a 5 digit code.</p>
<p>You will be asked to enter that code and confirm it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4203 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3.png" alt="3" width="243" height="134" /></p>
<p>You have few tries and when you are able to enter the right code you have verified your number on that new device.</p>
<p>Now the verification process starts! You will get a system message in BlueMail on your old device, with the identification of your phone number and request to <em>Insert Code</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4215" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/4-1-2.png" alt="4 (1)" width="241" height="299" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please insert the same code and if done correctly – your accounts will sync to the new device!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4205 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/5.png" alt="5" width="243" height="137" /></p>
<p>In this way, you can get all your accounts from the old device to your new device, securely and reliably.</p>
<p>Please Note: Backing up your account settings is part of our plans and on our roadmap, and may be released in one of the future updates.</p>
