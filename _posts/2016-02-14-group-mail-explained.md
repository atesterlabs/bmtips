Since a lot of your emails involve the same groups of people you regularly communicate with, we created the ability to define, send, and receive messages within BlueMail Groups naturally.

It makes a lot of sense to speed up the process of mobile email communications with groups. We’ve created Group Mail to address this. Sending mobile emails and receiving group emails has never been easier!

* [Create a Group](/creating-a-group/) - Bring your contacts together by creating a Group.
* [Send to Groups](/send-an-email-to-a-group/) – Instead of inserting all the contacts individually, write the group name and you are good to go.
* [Name & Photo](/naming-a-group-and-setting-a-photo/) – Assign a Group Name and a Photo for each group.

Group Mail by BlueMail is a big leap forward for mobile email users.
