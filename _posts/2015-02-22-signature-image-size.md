<p>We autofit the signature image so it can render it well on various recipient devices, it is best to use small images (up to 200Kb in size) and moderate dimensions (up to 500x500) if you want to maintain your logo as is.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008ffe;"><span style="color: #000000;">Note:</span><span style="color: #000000;"> BlueMail</span></span> supports still image types (jpeg, png) for the signature image.</p>
