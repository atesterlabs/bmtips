Modern E-Mail solutions support multiple devices, and ability to access your mail concurrently and simultaneously, making sign out unnecessary. If you want to shut BlueMail out, long tap on the home button and slide BlueMail sideways.

If you would like to make sure no one reads your mail, you can use our lock screen to prevent access to BlueMail, tap *More* \| *Global Settings* \| *Lock Screen (Passcode)*.
