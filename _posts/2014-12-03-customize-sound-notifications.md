In order to customize the sound notifications, please follow these steps:

*Accounts* \| *tap the account you want to update* \| **Custom Incoming Sounds** and choose the new incoming mail sound.
Note: Check you are not in silent mode, when checking sound notifications.
Also, Android is able to play only one sound at a time, so if you receive notifications on your emails from more than one apps, only one sound will be played.
