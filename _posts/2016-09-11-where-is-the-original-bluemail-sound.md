<p>If you love the older notification sound and would like to continue using it, simply <a href="//soundcloud.com/bluemail_app/incoming-mail">download it</a> to your device.</p>
<p>Next, place the sound file into your "Notifications" folder using the file manager. This varies between devices but usually is similar to:</p>
<p>/storage/emulated/0/notifications/</p>
<p>/storage/sdcard0/Notifications/</p>
<p>/storage/emulated/0/media/audio/notifications/</p>
<p>Finally in BlueMail, tap <em>More</em> (o o o) |<em> Notifications | Sound|Vibrate|LED | Incoming Sound | Custom Incoming Sound. </em></p>
<p>Other BlueMail sounds can be found on our <a href="//soundcloud.com/bluemail_app">SoundCloud</a></p>
