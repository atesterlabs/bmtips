If you love the older notification sound and would like to continue using it, simply <a href="//soundcloud.com/bluemail_app/incoming-mail">download it</a> to your device.</p>
Next, place the sound file into your "Notifications" folder using the file manager. This varies between devices but usually is similar to:</p>
/storage/emulated/0/notifications/

/storage/sdcard0/Notifications/

/storage/emulated/0/media/audio/notifications/

Finally in BlueMail, tap *More...* \| *Notifications* \| *Sound\|Vibrate\|LED* \| *Incoming Sound* \| *Custom Incoming Sound*.

Other BlueMail sounds can be found on our [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/bluemail_app)
