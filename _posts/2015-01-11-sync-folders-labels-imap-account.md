<p><span style="color: #000000;">BlueMail</span> shows all IMAP folders of your account as they exist on your Provider's Server.</p>
<p>If you don't see a folder in <span style="color: #000000;">BlueMail</span> that exists on your Provider's Server, you might need to "Enable" it for IMAP.</p>
<p>For example, to enable Gmail's Labels/Folders, see this <a href="//support.google.com/a/answer/105694?hl=en">article</a>, under 'Show folders in Gmail'.</p>
<p>Please note: We are planning to support client rules that will allow you to filter certain words in the subject or body of the mail, or domains in the sender address and assign them to a folder (such as a user folder or the spam folder).</p>
