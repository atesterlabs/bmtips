You can get to previous or next email from the current email view using:

* Up/Down arrows at the top right bar
* Volume keys of your device - configure with *More...* \| *Global Settings* \| *Advanced Features* \| *Volume Key Scrolling*.

Note: Pull down action will return you to the Inbox, so that you can use BlueMail with a single hand more conveniently.
