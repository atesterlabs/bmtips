<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Tasks</em> view shows all the Snoozed emails. This view allows you to distinguishÂ all the emails you need to handle ordered from the most urgent ones. You can also see mails whose designated time has elapsed. This allows you to prioritize your time based on urgency as well as importance.</span></p>
<p class="p1">When each such task reaches it's designated time, you get a push notification, also called snooze, as a reminder.</p>
