Spam emails come in all forms, from unwanted newsletters to claims of a long lost fortune from a *very* distant relative.

Normally, your provider uses very specialized software and techniques to prevent these emails from ever appearing. However, some emails may still get through to your inbox.

## Does BlueMail Support Spam Management?
**BlueMail** offers a Spam Management tool to *supplement* your provider’s existing spam filter by providing an option to **Block** emails that your provider’s “spam filter” did not catch. These Blocked emails will be added to your Block List and future emails from the spammer (or domain if chosen) will go directly to the Spam folder bypassing your inbox.

Note: The Block List for **BlueMail** is *personal* and *local* only for you while using **BlueMail**.

## How to Block a Sender?

There are two ways to Block a Sender:

* You can open the email and *tap the 3-dot menu* \| ***Block Sender***
* You can use **BlueMail's** [Swipe Menu](/swipe-menu-options-blue-mail/) which can be easily [configured](/configure-left-right-swipe-menu/) with a shortcut to "Block Sender".

After you've selected Block Sender, you'll have two options:

* Block Sender – Any mail that was received from this specific *email address* will automatically move to the Spam folder.
* Block whole domain – Any mail that was received from this domain will automatically be moved to the Spam folder.

This specific mail will be moved to Spam and all **future** emails from that sender's address or domain will now arrive in your Spam folder.

**Please note:** Other emails currently in the Inbox with this domain or address, will now display a Red Spam Indicator on the avatar.

## How to Unblock a Sender?

To Unblock a sender, go to the *Spam* folder \| Open the email | Tap the *3-dot-menu* \| *Unblock Sender* \| confirm with *OK*.

If your *provider* identified the email as spam, it will not have a Red Spam Indicator on it and will move the email to the Spam folder automatically. **BlueMail** will not be able to change this.

The Red Spam Indicator appears for emails Blocked using **BlueMail’s** Spam Manager. The Red Spam Indicator will not appear on Emails that your provider has filtered as spam.

## How Do I Unblock a Sender or Unblock a Domain From The Block List?

Email Addresses and Domains that were *previously* Blocked on **BlueMail** are displayed in the Block List.

To edit the Block List in **BlueMail**, please tap *More...* \| *Various Account Settings* \| *select the account* \| *Block List* \| *select either ***Addresses*** or ***Domains**** \| *tap the red X*

By tapping the red (X), you can Unblock that Sender or Domain and continue to receive emails from those addresses.
