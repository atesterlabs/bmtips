<p>BlueMail currently allows you to leave emails on the provider's server for POP3 accounts, as well as delete them in various circumstances.</p>
<p>Please go to <em>More | Various Account Settings</em> | Tap on your account | <em>Delete Messages on Server</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never - In order to keep emails on server (it is the default).</li>
<li>When deleting from trash - Emails will be deleted from server when deleted from the <em>Trash</em> folder.</li>
<li>When downloading messages - Emails will be deleted from server automatically when recieved.</li>
</ul>
