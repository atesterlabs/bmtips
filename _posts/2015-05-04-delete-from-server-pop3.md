BlueMail currently allows you to leave emails on the provider's server for POP3 accounts, as well as delete them in various circumstances.

Please go to *More...* \| *Various Account Settings* \| *Tap on your account* \| *Delete Messages on Server*:

* Never - In order to keep emails on server (it is the default).
* When deleting from trash - Emails will be deleted from server when deleted from the *Trash* folder.
* When downloading messages - Emails will be deleted from server automatically when received.
