BlueMail supports BCC. In compose mode, choose the 3-dots menu and select *Add Cc/Bcc*, it will fold additional lines for CC and BCC where you can add recipients.

You can also set these lines to be shown as default by using *More* | *Various Account Settings* | *Tap the account* | *Advanced Account Settings* | \*Always Show CC/BCC Lines in Compose\*.

Note: You can also [Add Yourself to BCC Automatically](/myself-bcc-automatically/)
