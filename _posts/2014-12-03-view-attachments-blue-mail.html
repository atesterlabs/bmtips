<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you view an email with attachments, tap on the attachment to start downloading it as BlueMail does not auto-download your attachments </span><span class="s1">in order to save your network resources. Tap once to start the download, and when it finishes, tap the attachment again to view it with an appropriate viewer or tap on the grey bar to save it.</span></p>
