The ability to present a badge on the app icon is a property of the home screen manager or “launcher” of your device.

We support app badge for the native launchers of many devices, as well as some common 3rd-party launchers.

To select which account's unread count to present on your main app icon: set it up with *More...* \| *Global Settings* \| *Unread Count* \| ***App Badge Number*** and select your desired account.

For other cases please check [Alternatives to Unread Count Badge on the App Icon](/alternatives-unread-count-badge/).
