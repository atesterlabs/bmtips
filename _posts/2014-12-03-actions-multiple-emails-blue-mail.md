You can perform an action on multiple emails at once by using **Multi Edit** mode.

You can get into this mode in two ways:

1. Using the [3-dots menu](/action-bar-menu/) on the top right of the email list view
2. Long tapping an email in the email list view

Once in this mode, you can select the mails you want to apply an action on, and then perform the action on all of them at once.
The actions include *Mark all, Delete, Move, Archive, Mark as Read / Unread, Mark as Done / Undone, Star / Unstar*, and other depending on context and email provider.
