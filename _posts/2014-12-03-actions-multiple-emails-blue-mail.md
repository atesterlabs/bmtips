<p class="p1">You can perform an action on multiple emails at once by using <em><b>Multi Edit</b></em>Â mode.</p>
<p>You can get into this mode in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the <a title="What are the Options in the Top Bar 3-dot Menu?" href="/action-bar-menu/">3-dots menu</a> on the top right of the email list view</li>
<li>Long tapping an email in the email list view</li>
</ol>
<p>Once in this mode, you can select the mails you want to apply an action on, and then perform the action on all of them at once.</p>
<p>The actions include <em>Mark all, Delete, Move, Archive, Mark as Read / Unread, Mark as Done / Undone, Star / Unstar</em>, and other depending on context and email provider.</p>
