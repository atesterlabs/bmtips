<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gmail has a default Archive folder called All Mail, which already pre-archives all mails. An Archive command for Gmail essentially removed the mail from Inbox and that's all (as it is already part of <i>All Mail</i>). This is Gmail specific behavior.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you want to change the 'Delete' functionality so it would also Archive your emails instead of moving them to the Trash Folder, you can change the Folder Mapping:</span></p>
<p class="p1">Go to <em>More | Various Account Settings | Choose your Gmail Account | Folder Management | Folder Mapping | Trash Folder | Choose [Gmail]All Mail</em></p>
