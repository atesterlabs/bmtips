To remove a contact from auto-complete, please tap *More...* \| *Edit Profile, Groups &amp; Contacts* \| *Contacts* \| *Search for the contact(s)*.

From here you have two options. Either you can remove the contact from displaying in your autocomplete listÂ or remove the contact entirely.

* To remove the contact from appearing in the autocomplete bar, without deleting this contact - please disable *Show this person in autocomplete*.
* To remove this contact completely, please tap the *3 dot menu* \| *Delete* \| *Yes*.
