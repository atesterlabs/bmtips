There are four different account's status options:

* Updated + time - The time the account was synced in.
* Syncing - The account is now retrieving mail.
* Connected - The account will receive email instantly.
* Connected + Quiet - The account will receive email instantly but no new mail notification will appear.

Note that *Updated* and *Syncing* statuses are more common in *Fetch* or *Manual*. [What are BlueMail’s Synchronization Modes?](/sync-options-type-mail/)
