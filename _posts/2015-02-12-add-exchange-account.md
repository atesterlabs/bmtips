<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">BlueMail</span></strong><span class="s2">Â supports both Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) and Exchange Web Services (EWS).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">If your provider supports Exchange ActiveSync, we highly recommend you add your account under this protocol, since our ActiveSync users benefit from enhanced Calendar and Contact sync.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">To add an exchange account: Tap More (ooo) | Various Account Settings | Add Account | Add Other Account | Exchange</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Enter your Email Address - Your Exchange email address is usually in the format of <i>Username</i>@<i>Domain</i>.com</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Enter your password - This is the same password you use for your Exchange account on your PC/Mac.</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">To add your account as ActiveSync please leave the "Prefer ActiveSync<strong>"</strong> box <strong>checked</strong>. If it is unchecked, it will be added as EWS. </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Tap Next, and wait a few seconds for your account to be setup.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><strong>Note:</strong> If you already have an account installed and would like to see the current protocol that is being used, tap More (ooo) | Various Account Settings | Choose Account | Edit Account | Protocol</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">If your account was previously added as EWS and you would like to switch it to EAS (if supported by your provider), please remove it by tapping More (ooo) | Various Account Settings | Select the account you would like to remove | Edit Account | "Remove Account", then add the account as EAS with the instructions above.</span></p>
