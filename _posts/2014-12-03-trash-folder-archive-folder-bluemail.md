Archive usually keeps the mail in Archive Folder, for future reference. Delete commonly puts the mail in a Trash folder, that is periodically cleaned, and can also be manually deleted forever on demand. You can access both of those folders from the Folders pane.

You can [View your Folders](/navigate-between-folders/) using: Swipe from left edge or by tapping the top left corner logo, and choosing the desired Account. Choose **Trash/Archive**.
