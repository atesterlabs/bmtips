With Cluster Mode enabled, Avatars come to life by giving you an intuitive way of navigating every email from that sender. There is no need to search for a single sender anymore.

There are three types of [*Clusters*](/what-are-clusters/) *People*, *Group*, and *Services*.

People: Tapping on this Avatar will show you every message from that specific person, in one convenient screen.

Groups: Keep conversations on topic by organizing emails into subjects. Displayed are subjects create by you or the group and inside the subject will show relatable conversations.

Services: Services are for all of those newsletters, coupons, or updates that, while important, can quickly leave your inbox looking like a mess. - P.S. This makes deleting a bunch of spam a breeze.
