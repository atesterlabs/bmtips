The People View is a new and original way to view your Inbox and reduce its clutter.

It arranges your emails into three types:
* People
* Groups
* Services

#### People
Tapping on one of the People will open a list of all your conversations with that person.

#### Groups
Tapping one of the groups will display all the Group's email threads.

#### Services
Opening a Service from the People view will open a list of all the emails you got from that Service.

The display is sorted based on the newest emails to the oldest.

### How can I see only Groups and Contacts?
Use the “Contacts” filter to view the emails from your Groups and Contacts.

Tap on the People View \| Tap on the top bar – center \| Contacts

### How can I see only Services?
Use the “Services” filter to view Services only.

Tap on the People View \| Tap on the top bar – center \| Services

This filter will only display emails from Services that are clustered together.
