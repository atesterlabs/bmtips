BlueMailÂ supports POP3 providers in addition to IMAP ones.

Note: Many POP3 providers support also IMAP. We strongly recommend configuring accounts with IMAP where applicable, as it is a more modern protocol, better suited for multiple mobile and other devices, folders synchronization and today's environment.
