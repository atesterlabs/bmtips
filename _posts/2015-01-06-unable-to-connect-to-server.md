This error means your device cannot connect to your provider's mail server. It can be anything from no network, intermittent or unstable network, or even a good internet connection in general but inability to reach your specific provider's mail server.

The most common solutions are:

* Switching your network from WiFi to cellular or vice versa.
* Using another WiFi network.
* Restarting your phone.
