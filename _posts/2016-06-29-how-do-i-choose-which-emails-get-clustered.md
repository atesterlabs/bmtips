With the cluster option available in the account picker, you choose your level of clustering to better suit your needs.

Please tap the middle top action bar of the screen where you can see ‘v’  then choose Clusters \| Select one of the below settings.

* On – All people &amp; services in your inbox will be clustered
* Only Services – Only services or newsletters will get clustered
* Off – Emails will not be clustered
