You can mark an email as Done with those methods:

* Using the [Bottom Bar Actions in Mail View](/bottom-bar-options-type-mail/).
* Using [Swipe Options in List View](/swipe-menu-options-type-mail/).

Email marked Done will appear on *Done* and *All* [Filters](/top-bar-left-triangle-menu/), but not on *Incoming* or *Later*.
