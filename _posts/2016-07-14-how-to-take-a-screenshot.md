To take a screenshot on the Samsung S7, simultaneously press both the power button (found on the top right) and the home button (found on the bottom center of your device). A shutter sound as a quick flash on the screen will let you know the screenshot has been successfully taken. Screenshots are by default saved in the Gallery app or your Google Photos.
