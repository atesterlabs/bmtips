You can clear the cache by tapping *More...* \| *Global Settings* \| *Advanced Features* \| **Clear Cache**.

After the process is done, BlueMail will re-download your emails according to the amount of days set in your Days to Sync setting.

Your stored Emails/Task/Later/Done will be cleared. Your Settings and Accounts will be kept intact.
