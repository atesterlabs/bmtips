Notifications use the notification bar, and show a short preview of the email.

BlueMail allows you to control the notifications method per account using *More...* \| *Notifications* \| *scroll to the account* \| *Instant Push Settings* \| *Push or Fetch* \| choose from four main options:

* Push - To get instant notifications.
* Push (No Preview) - To get instant notifications without a preview to reduce battery usage.
* No Push - To disable push notifications, but still see emails being updated when opening the app.
* Fetch - To get periodic notifications based on an interval set in *Fetch Interval* setting.
* Manual - To do on-demand refresh sync only, and do not get notifications.

If you choose *Fetch* method you can select the ***Fetch Interval*** - and choose how often you wish to check for new emails.

Please note that currently, only emails arriving in the Inbox will trigger a notification. Notifications for folders other than the Inbox is on our roadmap and may be released in the future.
