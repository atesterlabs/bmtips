For tablets, on the top right of your screen in BlueMail, you can tap the 2 arrows icon, this will switch between a split view to your main inbox list view

Note: For Phablets you can activate Split View by using: *More...* \| *Global Settings* \| *Advanced Features* \| *Display Mode* \| *Split Screen*. And restart BlueMail.
