<p>The People View is a new and original way to view your Inbox and reduce its clutter.<br />
It arranges your emails into three types:</p>
<ul>
<li>People</li>
<li>Groups</li>
<li>Services</li>
</ul>
<p>People<br />
Tapping on one of the People will <span class="s1">open a list of all your conversations with that person.</span></p>
<p>Groups<br />
Tapping one of the groups will display all the Group's email threads.</p>
<p>Services<br />
Opening a Service from the People view will open a list of all the emails you got from that Service.</p>
<p>The display is sorted based on the newest emails to the oldest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How can I see only Groups and Contacts?</h4>
<p>Use the “Contacts” filter to view the emails from your Groups and Contacts.</p>
<p>Tap on the People View | Tap on the top bar – center | Contacts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How can I see only Services?</h4>
<p>Use the “Services” filter to view Services only.</p>
<p>Tap on the People View | Tap on the top bar – center | Services</p>
<p>This filter will only display emails from Services that are clustered together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
