The current version of BlueMail supports a few kinds of widgets.

The basic one is a 1x1 widget as a launching pad for a specific mail account, or your unified inbox, and a badge showing approximately how many emails are unread in that account.

A more advanced 3x3 scrollable widget, in normal and transparent modes, allow you to view your emails directly from your home screen!
