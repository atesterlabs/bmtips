<p>For tablets, on the top right of your screen in BlueMail, you can tap the 2 arrows icon, this will switch between a split view to your main inbox list view</p>
<p>Note: For Phablets you can activate Split View by using: <em>More | Global Settings | Advanced Features | Display Mode | Split Screen</em>. And restart BlueMail.</p>
