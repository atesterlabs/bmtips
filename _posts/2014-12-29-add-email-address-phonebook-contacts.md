BlueMail offers a number of ways to achieve this:

* You can quick tap on the avatar / image of the sender from the mail list, and you will see the option to *Add this contact*.
* You can do the same from the mail view itself.
* You can long tap the sender (bold text) from the mail view and then *Add to Contact* option.
* Lastly,  and again from mail view, you can tap *More Details*, long tap any contact and then *Add to Contact* option.

Note: When you add a contact we interface to the existing contacts application, and you usually get options to create a new contact or to update an existing one.
