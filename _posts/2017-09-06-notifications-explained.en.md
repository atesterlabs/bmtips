## Notification Methods

Notifications use the notification bar, and show a short preview of the email.

BlueMail allows you to control the notifications method per account using _More..._ | _Notifications_ | _scroll to the account_ | _Instant Push Settings_ | _Push or Fetch_ | choose from four main options:

* Push - To get instant notifications.

* Push (No Preview) - To get instant notifications without a preview to reduce battery usage.

* No Push - To disable push notifications, but still see emails being updated when opening the app.

* Fetch - To get periodic notifications based on an interval set in _Fetch Interval_ setting.

* Manual - To do on-demand refresh sync only, and do not get notifications.

If you choose _Fetch_ method you can select the **_Fetch Interval_** - and choose how often you wish to check for new emails.gsfdgsdfg

Please note that currently, only emails arriving in the Inbox will trigger a notification. Notifications for folders other than the Inbox is on our roadmap and may be released in the future.
