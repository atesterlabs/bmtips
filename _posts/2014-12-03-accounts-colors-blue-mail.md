To visually identify to which account each email belongs to, we assign a color per account. This color appears in Unified Inbox per mail, identifies Read (empty) / Unread (filled) state.

You can change the Account's color by going to *More* \| *Various Account Settings* \| *tap the account you want to update* \| *Edit Account* \| *Account Color* \| **Choose a color and OK.**
