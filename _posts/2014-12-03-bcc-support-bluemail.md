BlueMail supports BCC. In compose mode, choose the 3-dots menu and select *Add Cc/Bcc*, it will fold additional lines for CC and BCC where you can add recipients.

You can also set these lines to be shown as default by using *More* \| *Various Account Settings* \| *Tap the account* \| *Advanced Account Settings* \| *Always Show CC/BCC Lines in Compose.

Note: You can also [Add Yourself to BCC Automatically](/myself-bcc-automatically/)
