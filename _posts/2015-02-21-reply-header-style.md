When you reply to a mail, the original mail is often shown with a preamble that gives some contextual information on that mail.

There are two common styles:

* Mobile Headers (Gmail Style) – The one BlueMail used so far, and is essentially a one liner that declares who sent the original mail and when.
* Full headers (Outlook Style) – A more elaborated style, where Sender and Recipients are shown each as a header.
