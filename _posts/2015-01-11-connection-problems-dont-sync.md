BlueMailÂ embeds a unique ability to detect not only connection to the network, but also actual network performance and specifically connectivity to your mail providers. So you may have internet but still not be able to access your email or send emails.

Few common solutions that solve this in many cases are:

* Switching your network between WiFi to cellular / data or vice versa.
* Restarting your phone.
