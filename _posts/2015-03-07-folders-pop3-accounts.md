POP3 accounts do not sync folders with your server.

For such accounts, BlueMail creates a folder for you if it does not yet exist so you can perform mail actions normally (e.g. the Spam / Archive / Trash folder would not exist in your Folder List until you [Block](/spam-management-support/) / [Archive](/archive-emails-type-mail/) / [Delete](/delete-an-email-type-mail/) for the first time).
