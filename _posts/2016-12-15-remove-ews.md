We have added some new enhancements to Exchange and Office365 support, including calendar and contact sync.

For these to work well,Â you may need to remove and re-add your account as Exchange ActiveSync.

To remove your account, please tap *More...* \| *Various Account Settings* \| *Select the account you would like to remove* \| *Edit Account and then Remove Account*.

When re-adding the account as ActiveSync please select *Add Other Account* \| *Exchange* \| ensure the ActiveSync checkbox is *enabled* and continue to add your account.
