<p>We have added some new enhancements to Exchange and Office365 support, including calendar and contact sync.</p>
<p>For these to work well,Â you may need to remove and re-add your account as Exchange ActiveSync.</p>
<p>To remove your account, please tap More (o o o) | <em>Various Account Settings | Select the account you would like to remove | Edit Account and then Remove Account.</em></p>
<p>When re-adding the account as ActiveSync please select <em>Add Other Account | Exchange</em> | ensure the ActiveSync checkbox is enabled and continue to add your account.</p>
