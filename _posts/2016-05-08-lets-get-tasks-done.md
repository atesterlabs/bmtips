Until now, emails had to be dealt with right away, or you’d risk forgetting about them. Now with [BlueMail](http://bluemail.me) you can take care of emails later without the hassle of complex mailbox rules.

*Tasks* sorts your inbox by which emails require your attention the most and will remind you about an email when you need it. There is no need to open a planner anymore. Simply mark the email *Snooze+* and let BlueMail know when you will have time. When you are ready, BlueMail will send you a notification to remind you.

Simply tap Done to turn that “To-Do” list into a “To-Done” list. The email will move to your Done folder leaving you with a clean Inbox.

The "Done" and "Snooze" filters are now available from within the Tasks view to help you better organise your task list. By tapping on the picker located underneath "Tasks", you are able to view emails that have been marked as "Done" or "Snooze" for emails that still require your attention.

By selecting the Auto Mark as Done setting under Global Settings, you can have replied messages be automatically marked as done.
