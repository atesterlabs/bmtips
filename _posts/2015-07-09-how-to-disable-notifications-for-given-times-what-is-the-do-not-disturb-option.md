You can select specific quiet times, for which notifications will be suppressed, to match your desires.

To do so, please go to *More...* \| *Notifications* \| *scroll to the account* \| *Do Not Disturb* \| uncheck *Always Notify* and set the periods accordingly:

* Quiet Days - If you mark days, for those days you will get NO notifications at all for the whole day - this may be usable for weekends, vacations, non working days etc. Note: Hours do not apply to marked days.
* Quiet Hours - If you mark a quiet hours range, notifications will be suppressed for those hours, on all days, useful for night time for example.
